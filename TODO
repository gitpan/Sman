		TODO LIST for SMAN
		Josh Rabinowitz, 2005

* Write Bundle::Sman 
  * to install or upgrade swish-e, SWISH::API, and other pre-reqs
    but only at the user's request

  * deal with issue of adding /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.config 
    or equivalent to handle the 'shared library can't be found' test 

* security: 
  * allow admin to configure user sman-update runs as:
    add USER and GROUP directives for sman-update settings
  * document running as low-priv user
  * check config and tmp file ownership - implement _issafe()
  * make taint-clean? use Safe.pm?
  * watch what we put on the command line more carefully

* parse non-english, non-multibyte, non-utf8 man pages...
  * such as those in  /usr/share/man/(cs|de|es|rt|ru)/
  * perhaps make a separate index for each language 

* adjust for possible SETENV LANG C type needs for UTF systems
 
* put information about indexing settings
  (perhaps the whole configuration file used) 
  in the index, or somewhere for later inspection,
  perhaps .../[indexname].settings

* arrange to have installer create complete html, ps, and pdf 
  docfiles (if possible) on the build system

* make man page parser better. 
  * consider passing options to 'man' to avoid line wrapping
  * recognize aliases and ".so /file/this" manpages

* we need input from groff and manpage experts
    on what makes sense on particular systems

* better tests. 
  * building a small index and searching on it. 
    (stuffing in canned XML, and by converting man pages)
  * converting one or more very, very common manpages (if found)
  * fix --testfile option on sman-update
  * check swish-e version is >= 2.4.0 or SWISH::API is > 0.00

* runlock to avoid 2 sman-updates at once.

* improve install:: routine in Makefile.PL to respect user's choices:
  * like where to install sman and sman-update

* consider handling .gz/.bz2 files ourselves,
  perhaps with 'preprocess' and 'postprocess' steps

* make sure tmp sman-swish-conf... files get 
  deleted if sman-update is interrupted

OUTPUT
* group identical/related man pages ala 'whatis'

* check for version of swish-e used

* check man, col, etc exist before using

* make XML 'most cannonical'

* code cleanup
